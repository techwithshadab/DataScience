### News Classification

#### Problem Statement: News Classification

Large volumes of news articles are received everyday from various sources. To simplify downstream processing tasks, one of the first steps is to properly categorise news into well defined categories. In this problem, you have been given a set of news articles and a set of categories. Your task is to develop a model which will be able to predict the category of unseen news.
